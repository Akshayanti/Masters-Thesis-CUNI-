<h1>Consistency of Linguistic Annotation</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

This thesis attempts at correction of some errors and inconsistencies 
in different treebanks. 
The inconsistencies can be related to linguistic constructions, 
failure of the guidelines of annotation, 
failure to understand the guidelines on annotator's part, 
or random errors caused by annotators, among others. 
We propose a metric to attest the POS annotation consistency of 
different treebanks in the same language, when the annotation 
guidelines remain the same. We offer solutions to some previously 
identified inconsistencies in the scope of the Universal Dependencies
Project, and check the viability of a proposed inconsistency detection 
tool in a low-resource setting. The solutions discussed in the 
thesis are language-neutral, intended to work with multiple 
languages with efficiency.
