<h1>Estimating Inter-Treebank POS Annotation Consistency in UDv2.5</h1>

For documentation, please refer [here](docs/)

<h2>makefile targets</h2>

1. `get_data`: Downloads and unzips the UDv2.5 data to `$HOME` directory.

2. `all_scores`: Get theta_POS scores for all the treebank combinations in UDv2.5. Results stored
in `UDv2.5_scores.tsv` file.
